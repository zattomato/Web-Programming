**This is Our Web Programmign Project**

**Project title : Online Community System**

**Description :**

  This system is intended to engage the residents in a neighbourhood (e.g.
  apartment condominium) and provide a way for residents to keep in touch with
  each other.

    The system should provide the following functions:
              Residents:
                  • User login to access the system, manage the sessions
                  • Manage user profile (view, update user details, delete a user account)
                  • View nearby facilities – can locate nearby facilities and shops, view
                  the details
                  • Register visitor coming to the resident’s house and the system can
                  generate a visitor pass.
                  • Report Covid-19 quarantine status to management office, residents also
                  can view the number of active cases on daily basis and weekly basis
              Administrator from Management office:
                  • Manage residents account (register new residents in the community, can
                  view the list of residents, update neighbour information, and delete an
                  account).
                  • Manage the Covid-19 reporting – validate, update and delete the
                  information.
                
                
**Phase 1: Week 3 to Week 8 (15%)**

        Phase 1 focuses on front-end Web development. You need to develop a prototype which
        contains the user interface design of the Web application. The following client-side Web
        technologies must be used to develop the front-end of your system:
            • HTML5
            • CSS
            • JavaScript
            • Front-end Design templates (e.g. Bootstrap)
        Additional technologies are allowed.


**Phase 2: Week 9 to Week 14 (25%)**

        Complete all the system development, including both client-side (front-end) and server-side (backend) development in this phase. Apart from the 
        client-side technologies, the Web application must
        also use a server-side scripting and a database. A technical report and a user manual of the system
        need to be prepared and submitted upon completion of the project. Each team is required to
        present the completed system.
